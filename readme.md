# css-declarations

**Stability: Legacy**.
This package is no longer recommended for use.
It’s still covered by semantic-versioning guarantees and not yet deprecated,
but use of this package should be avoided.
The project [`style-to-object`](https://github.com/remarkablemark/style-to-object)
is a maintained alternative.

Old
[documentation for this package](https://github.com/wooorm/css-declarations/tree/8bdcdc8)
is still available in Git.
